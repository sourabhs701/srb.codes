  about: `
I’m Sourabh Soni, a Full-Stack & Generative AI Engineer crafting scalable, cloud-native applications and intelligent systems powered by LLMs. My work spans from blockchain-based payment flows to distributed video streaming pipelines and self-hosted deployment platforms, blending system design, automation, and applied AI to solve real problems.

I’m also the creator of [MakeThumb](https://makethumb.com) — a self-hosted Vercel alternative that delivers one-click Dockerized builds, automatic asset deployment to S3, and secure multi-tenant reverse proxy routing. Designed for speed and scalability, it reduces React app deployment time from hours to minutes and provides developers with full control over their hosting pipeline.

Let's connect and collaborate!`,
